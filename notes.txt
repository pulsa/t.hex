::: Work Log :::

Sunday, 2006-05-07
Created "ahed" project.  Started HexWnd class?

Monday, 2006-05-08
Got window creation, basic painting, scrolling working.  Added ATimer class and tested
graphics primatives.  (The ones that don't draw anything are pretty fast, usually <3us.
20x small rectangles take about 20x longer than one big one.  FillRect() is faster than
Rectangle().)  Cursor positioning with mouse done today? (maybe tomorrow)

Tuesday, 2006-05-09
Added QString class.  Added VisualRange class.  Got ReadProcessMemory() working, with multiple
DLLs displayed in separate ranges.  Reviewed progress, comparing to other editors.  Filled out
to-do list.  Added collapsable ranges.

Wednesday, 2006-05-10
Moved stored settings to HexWndSettings class.  Added HexWndCmd.cpp and implemented simple
keyboard commands.  Fixed HitTest() to return region.  Added GetLineInfo().  Added
VisualRange.stored_address and display_address.  Finished ProcMemDataSource class.
Integrated DataView class from my frhed modification.  Added OpenFile(), OpenProcess(), and
an absolute basic command-line parser.  Sent a copy to Peter.

Thursday, 2006-05-11
Made SNV repository and checked in code.  Added basic WM_COMMAND handling.  Added
HexWnd::SetFont().  Added mouse selection.  Improved selection drawing.  Added flags to
GetByteRect().  Fixed m_pCurRange not getting set at start-up.  Added mouse wheel scrolling
and calls to Increase/DecreaseFontSize(), which are still empty.

Friday, 2006-05-12
Added s.iAddressBase and s.iByteBase.  Added keyboard selection.  Fought with font sizes.
Added clipboard functions.  Still not ready to edit real data.

Saturday, 2006-05-13
Researched undo facilities.  Decided to write my own.
Here's a good article: http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/transactions.asp
Added full-screen option.

Sunday, 2006-05-14
Undo.  Converted MoveCursor() to CmdMoveCursor() and worked on other Cmd stuff.

Monday, 2006-05-15
Started middle-button scroll stuff.

Tuesday, 2006-05-16
Worked on middle-button scroll stuff.

Wednesday, 2006-05-17
Finished middle-button scrolling.
Code is getting large and hard to work with.  Needs cleaning and focus.
Added CmdDigit(), WaitObjectList, status bar, and file map.

Thursday, 2006-05-18
Wrote AhedWindow class and decided to look into wxWidgets.  Finally got
minimal.cpp compiling with wxWidgets-2.6.3.

Friday, 2006-05-19
Oh, the agony of indecision.  Do I keep going, or build my features into
somebody else's program?  What framework is best for prototyping?  Will this be GPL?  Who is the target audience?
