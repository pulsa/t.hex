Marty's File Recovery
x	Read FAT info
x	Go to FAT entry
x	Go to cluster
x	Go to file
	Show as directory
	Show as boot sector
	Highlight cluster chain
x	Next/Prev cluster on disk
x	next/prev cluster in file
x	show current cluster number
	What does the directory structure say this cluster is?
	save disk data sources

Fixes
x	fix byte positioning
x	fix drawing of section headings (VisibleRange.info) (REMOVED)
x	fix MouseDown/MouseUp code when removing ScrollOriginWindow -- selection doesn't follow curByte
x	if clicked between bytes and selecting left, include last byte
x	fix: stop smooth scrolling on keypress (ah - don't get keys if not activated.  message hook?  child window?  no window at all?)
x	fix: why doesn't ALT+Space work?  OnChar() wasn't calling event.Skip()
x	enforce file size
	actions in overwrite mode with selection -- replace? change first, last, or current?
	move selection drawing outside PaintLine() to allow access to other lines?
	 - bottom of sel rect in top pixel of next line, right edge in next character
x	HitTest() and SelectionHitTest()
x	font size setting
x	update line with changed byte when typing, not just next byte (OnDataChange)
x	Unicode pane
x	erase scroll origin window when outside text display
x	shift+home
x	fix mouse selection end cursor positioning and click-hold select whole byte
	- select with granularity of current pane, i.e. 2 bytes for Unicode
x	adjust mouse selection for m_iScrollX
	make mouse selection line up with mouse-over highlighting
	string view not getting redrawn when moved vertically (resize frame, change status bar)
x	insert/undo several bytes, or maybe paste overwrite/undo <== (yes)
x	FileMap::bottomByte
	 - fix drawing at end of file when not green
	 - invalidate when document closes
x	painting is really slow when searching many Segments
	auto-panning sometimes gets off by one pixel.  Noticed with 2-pt font.
	don't highlight OnMouseMove when window not active
	figure out what Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn should do
x	update view window check boxes when closing the window with the button
	OFN_NODEREFERENCELINKS, OFN_HIDEREADONLY in wxFileDialog
	real message dialogs for opening LNK files
	gripper on map when horizontal, caption when it's vertical
	keyboard action when selecting with the mouse
x	look at StrFormatByteSize64() in MSDN docs (cool, but Win32 only, so no.)
	arrow navigation in Unicode/binary panes
x	ScrollWindowEx() with ruler
	MS uses "%I64", but wx-2.7.0 has replaced this with "%L".  Ouch.  See wxLongLongFmtSpec.
	selection drawing corners, 2 lines with overlap
	selection overlap in Unicode pane, sel = 0x03 + s.iLineBytes
x	move caret when auto panning
	reduce number of contiguous memory segments
	 - optimize copy & paste
	 - insert at end of existing segments
	Fix tool window frame drawing in wxFrameManager.  Bottom pixel of right section isn't getting drawn.
x	investigate DT_NOCLIP (Irrelevant.  DrawText() is still slower than TextOut().)
	Scroll dx and dy at the same time when autopanning?  Only a problem when moving at 45 degrees.
	first line of multi-byte numeric data (or Unicode) gets confused when shifted
	extra-large anti-aliased TT fonts draw garbage
	Selection drag after last line of text return wrong position
	make smart tabbing a user option
x	overflow in FP=>int math in scroll.cpp
	scrolling too fast?
	use wxFileName::GetShortcutTarget() instead of direct COM stuff?
x	full image path in ProcessDialog wxListCtrl tooltip (new column instead.  It has a tooltip.)
	option: show status bar (minus gripper) in full-screen mode
	right-click for data context menu, then middle-click for autopan, then middle-click again.  Badness.
	fix memory leaks caused by singleton class way down inside wxFlatNotebook::SetSelection()
???	Derive HexDoc from DataSource?
???	Is is worth having DisplayPane::HEX be separate for optimization purposes?
	Smarter caching.  Maybe two buffers, leap-frogging along.
x	DocList loses sort order when switching tabs.
	Make escape key closing combo box drop-down list instead of entire dialog.
	
	Fix this:
	Load up two files, A and B.  Copy lots of data from A to B.
	Move to beginning of A and end of A's data in B, and switch documents.
	Each doc still thinks A's FileDataSource has memory mapped, but it doesn't.
	Sometimes it's wrong data at the same address, or sometimes it moves to a new location.
	
Somehow I got really slow Unicode text painting today (2008-05-12).
	I think it happened when I started the program with several view windows, and then closed them.
	Only Unicode _text_ was slow; other garbage in the Unicode pane was fine.
	I was unable to duplicate this bug after I restarted the program.

2009-02-25
ReadSector() fails for a bad drive.  (ReadFile, actually.)
Fix this so it doesn't try to load akrip for bad hard drives.

2009-03-10
F6 06 02 00 04 doesn't get disassembled correctly in 16-bit mode.
I think this should be "test eds:[0002], 04".
"EA DE 00 00 20" isn't right, either.

PASTE OPERATION

Open clipboard and get data size
If undo buffer is available:
	allocate space for PasteAction
	if bInsertMode:
		pa.data = clipboard
	else:
		pa.data = clipboard ^ doc
	pa.Do()
	save pa in doc.UndoList
else:
	if bInsertMode:
		doc.InsertAt(address, clipboard)
	else:
		doc.ReplaceAt(address, clipboard)


Paste (Insert):
doc.InsertAt(address, clipboard) {
	if (undo) { new InsertAction().data = clipboard }
	DoInsertAt(address, clipboard)
	}

Paste (Overwrite):
doc.ReplaceAt(address, clipboard, oldSize, newSize) {
	if (undo) { new ReplaceAction().data = doc ^ clipboard }
	DoReplaceAt(address, ...)
}

DocChangeAction(address, oldSize, SerialData sdata, description)
{
	newSize = sdata.GetUncompressedSize()
	buffer = new uint8(max(oldSize,  newSize))
	doc.Read(address, oldsize, buffer)
	if (newsize > oldsize)
		memset(buffer + oldsize, newsize - oldsize, 0)
	sdata.xor(buffer)
}

SerializedChangeAction(address, oldSize, SerialData sdata, description)
{
	this.olddata = doc.serialize(address, oldSize)
	this.newdata = data
}

ImmediateChangeAction(address, oldsize, newsize, data)
{
	buffer = new uint8(max(oldSize, newSize))
	doc.Read(address, oldSize, buffer)
	if (newsize > oldsize)
		memset(buffer + oldsize, newsize - oldsize, 0)
	for (i = 0; i < newSize; i++) buffer[i] ^= data[i]
	this.zbuffer = compress(buffer)
	// this could be done 4 kB at a time into zbuffer
	store this.m_nAddress, this.m_nOldSize, this.m_nNewSize
}


What should we do when we get a character event and there is a selection?
Hexplorer: always operates on cursor byte, which is last byte included in selection
010: always replaces selection
FlexHex (insert): replace selection
FlexHex (overwrite): can't do this.  Prompt user to switch to insert mode.
Frhed is stupid.  It always switches to ASCII mode, after replacing selection.
HHD -- cursor has nothing to do with selection.  Weird.
HxD (overwrite): change first byte of selection
HxD (insert): warn about file size, replace selection
AXE 3: always operates in first byte after selection
AEdiHex: won't change file size in overwrite mode -- changes iSelEnd

should Ctrl+Up/Down move cursor onto screen?

dec, hex, float, double
file offset (relative to what, absolute)
zero-terminated string
string whose length is specified elsewhere
Unicode strings (UTF-8, UTF-32, UTF-16)

CycleClipboard
	paste current
	select pasted data
	if (!first)
		current--
	first = false
	Listen for Ctrl or Shift WM_KEYUP

WM_KEYUP (Ctrl or Shift)
	first = true

What happens when you use the "Copy As..." dialog?
1. Select format settings
2. sdata = HexDoc::Serialize(sel)
3. thClipboard::Copy(sdata, dlg.fmt) does only text formats, no hex data
...
4. WM_RENDERFORMAT => thClipboard::RenderFormat(CF_TEXT or CF_UNICODETEXT)
5. set fmt.encoding; get size from fmt.Render(NULL)
6. allocate buffer; fmt.Render(buffer); ::SetClipboardData(buffer)

Use Cases
===============================================================================
Rescue Marty's NTFS partion.
1. List partitions.
2. Open a partition for writing.

5. Save and close the new document.
6. Copy the last sector.
7. Paste it into the first sector.
8* Review changes
9. Save to hard drive

The drive list should show something like this, with the ability to sort:
